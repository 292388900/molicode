#MoliCode code generator

## Introduction

MoliCode is opensource software aimed at generate code automatically. It use maven repository to publish code template. After you have published you template (groovy or velocity or freemaker) to maven repository, anybody can download it by Maven Coordinates when they know it.

So it easier to publish code template and easier to download and use it. And we provide a friendly UI to configuration information and generate code.
